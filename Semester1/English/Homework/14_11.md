"Oppenheimer" is a thriller film directed by Christopher Nolan, based on the biography "American Prometheus" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Set during World War II, this film is a great example of a compelling and skillfully constructed story about a man who changed the world forever.

In 1942, physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer is recruited by the U.S. government to direct the "Manhattan Project", a secret operation to create the world's first nuclear weapon. Oppenheimer works tirelessly to create this weapon of mass destruction, pushing himself to the limit, but soon experiences the consequences of such dedication. After the "Little Boy" was dropped on Hiroshima, all blame is placed on Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of this weapon led to him being called the "father of the atomic bomb," a label he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life.

For me, the most notable thing about this film is Nolan's resourcefulness in handling some important scenes. The creative use of editing in these scenes keeps the pace brisk, which is especially necessary given the film's three-hour runtime.

There are few films that are able to tackle subjects like that in such detail and still remain interesting. If you're a fan of gripping biographical thrillers, "Oppenheimer" is a must-watch film that certainly won't disappoint you.
